My $\LaTeX$ base template

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Depends on my [dotfiles repository][dotfiles]
> for the common macros, settings, and shorthands used herein:
>
> - `common.tex`
> - `common/0.imports.tex`
> - `common/1.setup.tex`
> - `common/2.definitions.tex`.

You're free to reuse the template, but make sure you locate these dependencies
somewhere on your system and point to them in the preamble of your document.
